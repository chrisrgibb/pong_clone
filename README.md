An attempt at creating a pong kinda game using Ruby and the Gosu library.

I am using this as a learning experience to better myself at programming in the ruby language. I have probably done alot
of things wrong as there was a lot of stuff i was unsure of but i managed to figure it out enought to get it working.

I am currently working on a menu system for it using different states
and also trying to implement AI, again using these as a learning experience.
